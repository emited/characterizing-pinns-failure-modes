        # NB: If `do_power_iteration` is set, the `u` and `v` vectors are
        #     updated in power iteration **in-place**. This is very important
        #     because in `DataParallel` forward, the vectors (being buffers) are
        #     broadcast from the parallelized module to each module replica,
        #     which is a new module object created on the fly. And each replica
        #     runs its own spectral norm power iteration. So simply assigning
        #     the updated vectors to the module this function runs on will cause
        #     the update to be lost forever. And the next time the parallelized
        #     module is replicated, the same randomly initialized vectors are
        #     broadcast and used!
        #
        #     Therefore, to make the change propagate back, we rely on two
        #     important behaviors (also enforced via tests):
        #       1. `DataParallel` doesn't clone storage if the broadcast tensor
        #          is already on correct device; and it makes sure that the
        #          parallelized module is already on `device[0]`.
        #       2. If the out tensor in `out=` kwarg has correct shape, it will
        #          just fill in the values.
        #     Therefore, since the same power iteration is performed on all
        #     devices, simply updating the tensors in-place will make sure that
        #     the module replica on `device[0]` will update the _u vector on the
        #     parallized module (by shared storage).
        #
        #    However, after we update `u` and `v` in-place, we need to **clone**
        #    them before using them to normalize the weight. This is to support
        #    backproping through two forward passes, e.g., the common pattern in
        #    GAN training: loss = D(real) - D(fake). Otherwise, engine will
        #    complain that variables needed to do backward for the first forward
        #    (i.e., the `u` and `v` vectors) are changed in the second forward.
